# SIFT-mini-assignment
This project demonstrates object detection using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) in Python and OpenCV.   Given a query image (the object you want to find) and a target image (or video), the code detects and highlights the location of the query object in the target using robust feature matching.
